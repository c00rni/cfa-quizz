## My process

My designing process were inpired from the [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) documentation. First, I beak down the IU into a component
following the single [responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

The first version of the application use mock data. I'd like to build a fullstack application using firebase to have personalize quizz based on my notes of Charterd Financial Analyst (CFA) learning. To enhance my knowledge
of cloud architechture I would like to use firestore as backend.
